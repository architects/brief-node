# YAML Blocks

Yaml blocks can be extracted as data from the markdown document and not
displayed. This opens up some possibilities.

We could use YAML Blocks like this:

```yaml
replaceWith: visualization
visualizationType: MyCustomReport
parameters: whatever
```

And replace that node with a custom visualization.
